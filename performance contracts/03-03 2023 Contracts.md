## üí¨ Overall Comments on Goal Achievement

**Subject's Comments:** Reflecting on this year, it's been a journey filled with learning curves and stepping up to the plate. Kerusha's mentorship has been a guiding light, shaping the way I approach challenges. My highlight for this year has been the trust and belief in my capability shown by Kerusha. I am cherishing the responsibility of caretaking DFS and experiencing exponential growth in areas such as communicating with stakeholder, time management, delivering and planning. I am happy with the level of work and contributions that I have given this year, I've experienced a lot of growth from a technical perspective and still have much more rapid learning that I want to achieve. As the year folds, I'm ready to enter the next with the lessons learned and a spirit ready to take on even more. Still celebrating my promotion, thank you.

**Manager's Comments:** In Kersuha's absence i have provided the following feedback:

Once again Naso has had a very good year.

I appreciate that you have stepped into caretaking the product for Kerusha and thank you for your professional feedback and support. You really earned your promotion and i believe the future holds great things for you if you continue on this path.

Naso has performed at a very high level for the second year in a row.

Previously he received an Exceptional rating and the reason for this year as a Met Expectations was as a result of the higher expectation given his promotion.
